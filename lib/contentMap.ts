H1: Avoid Foreclosure in Florida

If you're facing foreclosure in Florida, you may feel like there's no
way out. But foreclosure isn't inevitable—you have options, and time
is on your side if you act now. One of the most effective ways to avoid
foreclosure is to sell your house before the process completes.

## The Florida Foreclosure Timeline

-   **Missed Payments:** After 3-6 months of missed payments, the lender
typically begins the process

-   **Lis Pendens:** The lender files a lawsuit and records a notice of
pending action

-   **Court Proceedings:** You're served and have 20 days to respond;
this can take several months

-   **Judgment:** If the lender wins, the court issues a final judgment
of foreclosure

-   **Auction:** Property is sold at public auction, typically 20-35
days after judgment

## Why Foreclosure Hurts

-   **Credit Damage:** Foreclosure stays on your credit for 7 years

-   **Future Housing:** Difficult to rent or buy for years afterward

-   **Deficiency Judgment:** You may still owe money if the sale
doesn't cover your debt

-   **Lost Equity:** Any equity in your home disappears

-   **Public Record:** Foreclosure is public information anyone can find

## How Selling Stops Foreclosure

Selling your house before foreclosure completes pays off your mortgage
and stops the process. A cash sale is fastest because there's no
financing contingency—we can often close in 7-14 days, well ahead of
most foreclosure timelines.

Introduction

Inheriting a house in Florida can feel like a mixed blessing. On one
hand, you've received a valuable asset. On the other, you're now
responsible for property taxes, maintenance, insurance, and potentially
a mortgage—all while dealing with grief and possibly living hundreds
of miles away.

If you're wondering how to sell an inherited house in Florida, you're
not alone. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the probate
process, your selling options, tax considerations, and how to make the
best decision for your situation.

Understanding Florida Probate

Before you can sell an inherited property in Florida, it typically needs
to go through probate—the legal process of validating the will and
transferring ownership. Florida has two main types of probate:

(excluding homestead property) or when the deceased passed away more
than 2 years ago. This is a faster, simpler process.

representative is appointed to manage the estate, which includes the
ability to sell real property with court approval.

Can You Sell During Probate?

Yes, in many cases you can sell an inherited house during probate—you
don't have to wait until the process is complete. The personal
representative can petition the court for permission to sell. This is
particularly useful when the estate needs cash to pay debts or when
maintaining the property is impractical.

Your Three Options for Selling


The traditional approach involves hiring an agent, making repairs,
staging the home, and waiting for the right buyer. This typically takes
3-6 months and costs 6-10% of the sale price in commissions and fees.

Best for: Properties in good condition when heirs aren't in a hurry and
can manage repairs remotely.


You handle everything yourself—pricing, marketing, showings,
negotiations, and paperwork. Saves the listing commission but requires
significant time and expertise.

Best for: Heirs who live locally, have real estate experience, and want
to maximize proceeds.


Cash buyers like Garrison Point Solutions purchase the property
directly, as-is. No repairs, no clean-out, no showings. Close in as
little as 7 days.

Best for: Heirs who need to sell quickly, live out of state, can't
afford repairs, or want to avoid the hassle of traditional selling.

What About All the Stuff?

One of the biggest challenges with inherited properties is dealing with
a lifetime of belongings. Sorting through furniture, personal items, and
household goods can take weeks and be emotionally draining.

If you sell to a cash buyer, you can leave everything behind. We handle
the clean-out—take what you want, leave the rest.

Tax Considerations

Good news: When you inherit property, you receive a "stepped-up
basis." This means your cost basis is the property's fair market value
at the time of the deceased's death—not what they originally paid. If
you sell soon after inheriting, you may owe little or no capital gains
tax.

However, tax situations are complex. Always consult with a CPA or tax
attorney for your specific circumstances.

Next Steps

If you've inherited a property in Florida and want to explore your
options, we're here to help. We specialize in buying inherited
properties and can work within the probate process to facilitate a
smooth sale.

Q1: How do you determine your offer price?

We evaluate several factors: the property's current condition, needed
repairs, recent comparable sales in your area, and current market
conditions. Our offers typically range from 70-85% of the after-repair
value, minus estimated repair costs. We're transparent about how we
arrive at our number and happy to explain our reasoning.

Q2: Do I have to accept your offer?

Absolutely not. Our offers are completely no-obligation. You're free to
accept, counter, or decline. There's no pressure, no time limits
(unless you're facing an external deadline like foreclosure), and no
cost to you for receiving an offer.

## Common Code Violations We Handle

-   **Unpermitted Work:** Additions, conversions, or renovations done
without permits

-   **Open Permits:** Work that was started but never passed final
inspection

-   **Property Maintenance:** Overgrown vegetation, junk, or debris
issues

-   **Structural Issues:** Unsafe structures, damaged roofs, or
foundation problems

-   **Zoning Violations:** Illegal rentals or commercial use in
residential zones

-   **Accumulated Fines:** Daily fines that have grown into tens of
thousands of dollars

## The Code Violation Trap

Many homeowners get caught in a vicious cycle: they can't afford to fix
the violations, but the daily fines keep growing. Traditional buyers
won't touch properties with major code issues. And even if you could
sell, the liens must be satisfied at closing—often leaving nothing (or
a bill) for the seller.

## How We Can Help

We've worked with properties that have tens of thousands in accumulated
fines. In many cases, we can negotiate with code enforcement to reduce
fines or work out payment arrangements as part of the sale. We buy the
property as-is, handle the violations after closing, and you walk away.

H1: Sell an Inherited House in Florida

Inheriting a property can feel like inheriting a burden—especially
when you're dealing with grief, distance, or disagreements among family
members. If you've inherited a Florida home and want to sell it quickly
without the hassle of repairs, clean-outs, or the traditional listing
process, Garrison Point Solutions can help.

## Understanding Florida Probate

In Florida, inherited property typically goes through probate before it
can be sold. There are two main types:

-   **Summary Administration:** For estates under $75,000 or when the
deceased passed more than 2 years ago. Faster and simpler.

-   **Formal Administration:** For larger estates. Requires court
oversight but typically allows property sales with court approval.

Good news: In many cases, you can sell the inherited property during
probate with proper court approval. We work with executors, personal
representatives, and heirs to facilitate timely sales.

## Your Options for Selling an Inherited House

1.  **List with a Real Estate Agent:** Traditional route, but requires
repairs, staging, showings, and 3-6+ months of waiting.

2.  **Sell For Sale By Owner (FSBO):** Saves commission but requires
significant time and expertise.

3.  **Sell to a Cash Buyer (Like Us):** No repairs, no clean-out, no
showings. Close in as little as 7 days. We handle everything.

## Why Heirs Choose Garrison Point

-   **Skip the Clean-Out:** Leave everything behind—furniture,
belongings, even junk. We handle it all.

-   **No Repairs Needed:** Sell as-is, regardless of condition

-   **Probate-Friendly:** We understand Florida probate and work within
its requirements

-   **Fair Cash Offer:** Transparent pricing based on property value and
condition

-   **Fast Closing:** Close in 7-14 days or on your timeline

## Tax Considerations

When you inherit property in Florida, you typically receive a
"stepped-up basis"—meaning your cost basis is the property's fair
market value at the time of inheritance, not what the original owner
paid. This can significantly reduce capital gains taxes if you sell. We
always recommend consulting with a tax professional for your specific
situation.

you beat the auction clock.

## Understanding the Pre‑Foreclosure Timeline

- **Missed Payments:** After several months of missed mortgage
  payments your lender files a public notice (Lis Pendens).
- **Court Proceedings:** Once served, you typically have 20 days to
  respond. The legal process can take months, but time is working
  against you.
- **Auction Date:** If the court awards judgment to the lender, the
  house is scheduled for auction—often 20–35 days later.

## How a Cash Sale Helps

- **Stops Foreclosure:** The sale proceeds pay off your mortgage in
  full, halting the legal process.
- **Protects Your Credit:** Avoid the 7‑year credit hit that comes
  with foreclosure.
- **Preserves Equity:** Walk away with any remaining equity instead of
  losing everything at auction.

  'we-buy-houses-fort-myers-what-to-expect': `sell my house fast fort myers*


Introduction

You've probably seen the signs: "We Buy Houses" plastered on
telephone poles and street corners. Maybe you've gotten postcards or
letters from companies offering to buy your Fort Myers home for cash.
But what does it actually mean to sell to a cash home buyer? Is it
legitimate? What can you really expect?

In this article, we'll pull back the curtain on how "we buy houses"
companies work, what the process looks like, and how to identify a
reputable buyer in Fort Myers.

What Are "We Buy Houses" Companies?

"We buy houses" companies are real estate investors who purchase
properties directly from homeowners. Unlike traditional buyers who need
mortgage approval, these companies use their own cash—which means they
can close quickly and buy properties in any condition.

The business model is straightforward: they buy houses at a discount,
make repairs if needed, and either resell them for a profit or keep them
as rental investments.

The Typical Process

4.  **You reach out:** Either by phone, website form, or responding to
marketing

5.  **Initial conversation:** The buyer asks about your property and
situation

6.  **Property evaluation:** May include a visit or, increasingly,
virtual walkthrough

7.  **Cash offer:** You receive a written offer, typically within 24-48
hours

8.  **Your decision:** Accept, negotiate, or decline—no obligation

9.  **Closing:** If you accept, close in as little as 7-14 days

How Much Do Cash Buyers Pay?

This is the question everyone asks—and it depends. Most cash buyers
pay somewhere between 70-85% of the property's after-repair value
(ARV), minus the cost of needed repairs.

The discount accounts for the buyer's risk, repair costs, holding costs
while renovating, and profit margin. In exchange, you get speed,
certainty, and the convenience of selling as-is.

When Does Selling to a Cash Buyer Make Sense?

-   You need to sell quickly (job relocation, foreclosure, divorce)

-   Your property needs significant repairs you can't afford

-   You've inherited a property you don't want

-   You're a tired landlord wanting out

-   You value convenience over maximizing price

How to Spot a Reputable Buyer

-   Local presence with verifiable address and phone

-   Positive reviews on Google or BBB

-   Transparent about their process and how they make money

-   No pressure tactics or urgency manipulation

-   Willing to show proof of funds
