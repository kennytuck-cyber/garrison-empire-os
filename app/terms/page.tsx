          <p>These Terms and any disputes shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida, without regard to its conflict‑of‑law principles. Any dispute arising under these Terms that cannot be resolved informally will be resolved in binding arbitration on an individual basis in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act. You waive the right to bring or participate in a class action. Consult an attorney to ensure this arbitration clause is enforceable in your jurisdiction.</p>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white">7. Modifications</h2>
          <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will post the updated Terms on our website with a new “last updated” date. By continuing to use the Services after any changes become effective, you agree to the revised Terms.</p>
